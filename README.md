# Python Tools: 🐍🛠️
>- Have you ever taught of wirting your own code to parahrase sentences, resize photos when submitting online pictures, converting documents from one form to another. Dont worry just run the codes to make your work easier.


### PDF Converter: 📄🔄💻
PDF Converter is a Python tool that allows you to convert PDF files to other formats, such as Word, Excel, HTML, and image formats like JPG and PNG. This tool can come in handy when you need to extract data from a PDF file, or if you want to convert a PDF file to a more editable format.

There are different Python packages available for PDF conversion, including PyPDF2, pdfminer, and pdftables. These packages can be used to manipulate PDF files and extract data from them, or convert them to other formats.

### Paraphraser: 📝🔄💻
Paraphrasing is the process of rewording or restating a text in a different way while maintaining the same meaning. A paraphraser is a tool that can help you automate this process. It takes a piece of text as input and produces a paraphrased version of the same text.

There are different Python packages available for paraphrasing, including NLTK and GPT-3, which are powerful language processing libraries. These libraries use techniques like natural language generation (NLG) and machine learning to generate paraphrased versions of text.

### Image to Text OCR: 📷📝💻
Image to Text OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a Python tool that converts images containing text into machine-readable text. It extracts the text from images and converts it into an editable format.

There are different Python packages available for OCR, including pytesseract and OpenCV. These libraries use machine learning algorithms to recognize the characters in an image and convert them into text. This tool can be useful when you need to extract text from scanned documents, images, or handwritten notes.

These Python tools are useful for a variety of tasks, such as data extraction, text manipulation, and document processing. They are easy to use and can save you time and effort in your coding projects. 🚀


### Mathematics: 📝💻
In the second code, the lcm function calculates the LCM by iteratively computing the least common multiple between two numbers using the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b). The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) function is defined separately using the Euclidean algorithm.

When you run the code and enter the numbers 10, 20, 30, it will output 60, which is the Lowest Common Multiple of those numbers.


The first code iterates from 1 to the smallest number in the list and checks if all the numbers in the list are divisible by that current number. If so, it adds the number to the set of common factors. Finally, it prints the set of common factors.

For example, if you input the numbers 4 and 6, the code will output The common factors of the given numbers are: {1, 2} since 1 and 2 are the common factors of both 4 and 6.
